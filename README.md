Program to help with FFA BIS w/ Loot Lockout system
Here is my statics rules for this loot distro
What does FFA BIS mean?
If a BIS item drops for you, you have the ability to roll for it.

What does loot lockout mean?
If you receive the item you are locked out of any items from that fight for the current week and next week. (i.e. you need a ring and neckless from P9 - you win the ring this week, you're lockout out of the neckless this week and next week)

What if I'm the only person that needs this item from this boss fight?
BIS will always be priority if you are the only one that needs the item it will bypass the lockout and the item is yours!

Does this lockout apply to the mount?
No the mount is not included in the lockout, everyone can roll on it each week.

What about loot for my alt?
FFA BIS will work in the same way if no one needs an item everyone who has selected an ALT in the google doc will have the ability to roll on the item with the same lockout rules.

What happens with the Tome Weapon upgrade materials?
This will prio to DPS members to ensure DPS checks are not as bad.

What happens with the savage weapons when some members already have the tome weapons?
Savage weapons will prio to any member that does not have an upgraded Tome Weapon.
